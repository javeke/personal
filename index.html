                    Second-year University of the West Indies student Javier Bryan, 20, has been developing a device that is able to 
                    remotely monitor a person's vital signs. Bryan, who is reading for a Bachelor of Science degree in electronics and 
                    computer science, started creating the machine after COVID-19 reached Jamaica.

                    Bryan, who resides in Water Lane, Clarendon, says the machine is not yet completed and is still in the 'prototyping'
                    phase. The Glenmuir High graduate said that he has spent plenty of time honing his skills by working on other similar 
                    projects. Bryan said that if he's given the opportunity to produce more of the devices, he would gladly take up
                    the task.

                <p> 
                    My name is Javier Bryan, an aspiring robotics engineer. I attended Glenmuir High School and I am currently a first 
                    year student attending the University of the West Indies (UWI), Mona, pursuing a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer 
                    Science and Electronics. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am very grateful to be selected to be a student participant in the fourth annual Calico Challenge. I have always 
                    had a passion for computer programming ranging from embedded systems programming to game development and also mobile 
                    and web development. I was very excited when I got word of a program that seeks to promote growth and allow students
                    to gain valuable experience in the field during the summer holiday. This will be my first time participating in and 
                    contributing to an open source project and I really look forward to the experience.
